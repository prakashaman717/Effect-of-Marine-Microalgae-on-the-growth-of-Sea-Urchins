## GNPS Molecular Network Analysis

Here, I used [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp) to create a network of molecules. I focused on a type of N-Formylcytisine Collisio biocompounds and examined the network of molecules that are close to it in terms of the similarity of their MS/MS spectra.



As you can see, there is a close molecule that is unidentified and has a molecular weight difference of 27.989.

Below are the profiles of the two molecules, with the unidentified molecule shown at the bottom.



The mass difference may suggest a substitution between valine and alanine, methionine and cysteine, acylation, or other modifications, as detailed in the table from UNIMOD:

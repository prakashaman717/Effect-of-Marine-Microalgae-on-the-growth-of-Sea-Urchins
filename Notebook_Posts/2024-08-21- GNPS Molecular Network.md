## GNPS Molecular Network Analysis
  It stands for the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking database. GNPS is a web-based mass spectrometry ecosystem that aims to be an open-access knowledge base for             community-wide organization and sharing of raw, processed, or annotated fragmentation mass spectrometry data (MS/MS). GNPS aids in identification and discovery throughout the 
  entire life cycle of data; from initial data acquisition/analysis to post publication.

   Steps :- 
   1. Login to the account if you have or create one and log in.
   2. Go to Molecular Networking and create molecular network.
   3. Give a title to your work and scroll down to select input files and share files.Add the file MSV000082622 and import.
   4. Mkae sure you import and add the files correctly and it will seen in G1.
   5. Leave the parameter as defacult. It depends on your job.
   6. Hit the submit and wait for the results. Wait for the complete process and don't click anything.
   7. Result page will appear as below :-

  8. Select the option of Visualize networks and a list will be opened and the select the desired molecule which will be considered for the further analysis.  
  
Let's do a task as following :- 

## Assigned Task ##

Here, I used [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp) to create a network of molecules. I focused on a type of N-Formylcytisine Collisio biocompounds and examined the network of molecules that are close to it in terms of the similarity of their MS/MS spectra.

In the following picture we have focused on 268 and 249 numbered molecules.

As you can see, there is a close molecule that is unidentified and has a molecular weight difference of 27.989.

Below are the profiles of the two molecules(268 & 249) ,with the unidentified molecule down.

The mass difference may suggest a substitution between valine and alanine, methionine and cysteine, acylation, or other modifications, as detailed in the table from UNIMOD.UNNIMOD is a website for the protein modifications for mass spectrometry. [UNIMOD](https://www.unimod.org/login.php)

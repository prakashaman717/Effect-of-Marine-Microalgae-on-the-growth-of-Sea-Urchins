# Effect of Marine Microalgae on the growth of Sea Urchins *Paracentrotus Lividus* #

### Sea Urchins holds the future ###

Sea urchins are a crucial aquatic economic organism which have been widely use the modal system for studying gene regulation and biomineralization and have a crucial role in marine ecosystems.In many nations, sea urchins are a significant aquatic economic creature due to their high food value and vital role in the marine ecosystem. On the other hand, it has recently been overfished to the point of near extinction, and its continued existence is crucial for the long-term viability of sea urchin farming. Sea urchins are vulnerable to dying while still in their larval state. In order to determine whether different types of microalgae can increase sea urchins' rates of development and survival, two types of microalgae were employed as the initial food source in this study.I am using the different concentrations of *Phaeodactylum* and *Dunaliella salina* are fed to P. Lividus and their growth are documented. My research should reveal molecular mechanisms essential to the development of the sea urchin's body and other metabolic processes. Understanding the food that they eat and its potential impacts will aid in our comprehension of P. Lividus' feeding habits. With the use of this data, we can support the recovery efforts of sea urchin aquaculturists and further assist in mitigating the harm caused by climate change to their native Mediterranean and Israeli coasts. It will facilitate and ease the numerous research labs' and institutes' access to this modal organism supply. Long-term, it may contribute to maintaining the equilibrium of the marine ecosystem along Israel's coast.

The life cycle of sea urchins is compraised of two parts :- Planktonic Larval Phase and Adult benthic phase.Depending upon on their stage they have different needs and requirements.

During the life cycle the sea urchins requires the food like the other biological living organisms. My experiment is ellucidate the effects on the growth depending on their feed.So, I have selected two different kinds of mircoalage which were fed to the larval culture of sea urchins and their growth were documented.The prominent parameters which will be focused as the the basis of growth among them are :- 
(i) Rod Length
(ii) Body Length
(iii) Different Stages of development

**Updates**

Till now, I have successfully grown the cultures till the 14 days but after that they died unexpectedly. Some of the selected pictures are here below :-

**Long Term Goals**

The long term goal of this project it to set up the breeding protocol of the sea urchins. As mentioned they are the excellent model system to study and can be a supplier to the many labs. Setting up of this protocol will led to development and in vitro breeding of various other species of se urchins which can be used for various associated studies.
